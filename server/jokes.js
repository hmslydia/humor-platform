Microsoft has been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and play.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It believes these technologies will\ngive it substantial leverage in penetrating the copulation enhancement market. The product addresses two important user concerns: the need for virus protection and the need for a firewall to ensure the non-propagation of human beings.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contraceptive98 suite consists\nof three products: Condom98, DeFetus 1.0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.1 (from Norton\nUtilities). A free copy of Intercourse Explorer 4.0 is bundled in the package. The suite\nalso comes in two expanded versions. Contraceptive98 Professional is the Client/Server\nedition, for professionals in the sexual services sector. Contraceptive98 Small Business\nEdition is a package for startups, aimed at the housewife and gigolo niches.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Contraceptive98 does not address nontraditional copulatory channels, future plug-ins are planned for next year.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPERATION: Only one node in a\npeer-to-peer connection needs to install the package.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At installation, the Condom98\nsoftware checks for minimum hardware. If the user meets the requirements, the product\ninstalls and is sufficiently scaleable to meet most requirements. After installation,\noperation commences. One precaution is that the user must be sure they have sufficient RAM to complete the session. When the session is complete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user gets the message, it is now safe to turn off your partner.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DRAWBACKS: Usability testers report that frequent failures were a major concern during beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most serious error encountered. Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of these have been eliminated. The product needs to be installed each time its used.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION: Contraceptive98 is a\nrobust product. Despite its drawbacks, it is reasonably good value for its $49.95 price\ntag, and is far superior to its shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the\nsoftware, that is) will add missing functionality, such as Backout and Restore,\nuninterruptible Power Supply and Onboard Camera.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is optimistic that &quot;Our contraceptive products will help users do to each other what we've been doing to our customers for years.&quot;"}, {"source": "/Users/hmslydia/Downloads/funny-jokes-database.csv", "num": "8909", "joke_text": "There was a woman who wanted to repaint her house, so she called the contractor and set an appointment to meet with him.
