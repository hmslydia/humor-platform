          Why are jokes funny?
        </div>
        <p>
        Humor is one of the greatest mysteries of human nature. Philosophers have pondered it, but no one has figured it out. Our mission is to use an army of people to analyze millions of jokes, and finally collect the evidence needed to determine why jokes are funny.

        <p>
        There are six patterns for humor we are currently testing.  These patterns have been collected from philosophers ranging from Plato to Kant. Jokes can fall into multiple of these patterns at once.          </p>

      A joke can set you up to expect one thing, but then violate that expectation by giving you something else.

      <h2>Connect the Dots</h2>
      A joke can be funny because it makes you figure out how to connect the dots between bits of information it gives you.

      He says there are <u>three</u> types of people, but then lists only <u>two</u> types. From this you have to connect the dots to figure out that the speaker can't actually count.  (This is also an insult towards himself)

      <h2>Lens</h2>
      A lens joke helps you see one situation through two different lenses, men vs. women, parent vs. children, clean vs. dirty way of interpreting something, etc.

      The first speaker is trying to give sincere career advice. However, when the second person said "That's what she said" the career was re-interpreted through a sexual lens.  Lens 1: career advice, Lens 2: sexual innuendo.

      Sometimes all a joke needs to do is point something out. It can be clever, or senseless, obvious or astounding.

      The observation here is that men like to channel surf, as opposed to actually watching TV, which is sort of senseless.    </div>
